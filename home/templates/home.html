    <p>A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, crypto, or coin is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange
        through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold
        or
        maintain it.[2]</p>
    <p>Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong
        cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the
        transfer of
        coin ownership.[3][4][5] Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the
        traditional
        sense and while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities,
        securities, as
        well as currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.[6][7][8] Some
        crypto
        schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as
        collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally,
        these token
        stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such
        reward
        mechanisms.[9]</p>
    <p>Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central
        authority.
        Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).[10]
        When a
        cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered
        centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger
        technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.[11] Traditional
        asset
        classes like currencies, commodities, and stocks, as well as macroeconomic factors, have modest exposures to
        cryptocurrency returns.[12]</p>
    <p>A cryptocurrency is a tradable digital asset or digital form of money, built on blockchain technology that only
        exists
        online. Cryptocurrencies use encryption to authenticate and protect transactions, hence their name. There are
        currently
        over a thousand different cryptocurrencies in the world.[13]</p>
    <p>Over the last few years, cryptocurrency prices have risen and then fallen. Crypto marketplaces do not guarantee
        that an
        investor is completing a purchase or trade at the optimal price. As a result, many investors take advantage of
        this by
        using arbitrage to find the difference in price across several markets.[14]</p>
    <p>The first decentralized cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which first released as open-source software in 2009. Since
        the
        release of Bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have been created.</p>
