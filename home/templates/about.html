    <p> What Is Cryptocurrency?</p>
    <p>
        A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining 
        feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not 
        issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

    <p> Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. 
        They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption 
        algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.
        Cryptocurrencies can be mined or purchased from cryptocurrency exchanges. Not all ecommerce sites allow purchases using cryptocurrencies. In fact, cryptocurrencies, even popular ones like Bitcoin, are hardly used for retail transactions. However, the skyrocketing value of cryptocurrencies has made them popular as trading instruments. 
        To a limited extent, they are also used for cross-border transfers. </p>
